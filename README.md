# Calculator
Date: 13/01/24

This is a simple 3 hour project. The code utilises the tkinter library and produces a simple GUI calculator. The calculator can perform addition, subtraction, multiplication and division on whole as well as decimal numbers. The user clicks the buttons containing the values they need to compute, and then press = to finally compute the result.

# Future Improvements
- Code that allows user to type in their calculation
- More aesthetic UI, including button color and cursor changes
- more functions, like indices, roots and logs
- constant and programmable variables, such as e, x, y

  My code takes a lot of inspiration from GFG (https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/python-simple-gui-calculator-using-tkinter/)
